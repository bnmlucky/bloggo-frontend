# bloggo
Final project for GA SEI bootcamp that will continue evolving as my personal blog.

# MVP

1.  Full CRUD app: a blog where you can add a post, edit a post, view all posts and delete a post.
2.  User can add photos to posts.
3.  Each post can have a comment posted underneath it.
4.  Very well styled.

# Post MVP

1. Separate workflows for the owner of the blog and guests: they can create/edit/delete posts and delete comments as well.
2. Guests will be able to leave comments on the blog.
3. Create an About page that will be static and won't allow to leave comments.
4. Create a "Contact Me" page, which will contain a form with contact info, a form to submit and a map.
5. Separate blog entries into sections by topic: for example, Coding, Books, Travels, Life.

# Technologies used

1. Still debating whether it is MERN stack or Ruby on Rails backend + React frontend.
2. Would like to try Bulma CSS framework/explore more CSS frameworks, as I plan to make my own in the future.

# Wireframes

I do not have wireframes just yet, although I have installed and started using Balsamiq for that.
However, I have several examples of other blogs that inspire me.  I want mine to look like them in one way or another:
1. https://galmeetsglam.com/
2. https://cupofjo.com/
3. https://abeautifulmess.com/
4. https://sayyes.com/
5. https://witanddelight.com/

# ERD
